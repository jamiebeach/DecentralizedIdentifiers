# Decentralized Self-Soverign Identifiers
Articles and links about decentralized identifiers and soverign identity

## What is a DID?
- Decentralized identifier
- Like regular unique identifiers (address, email, username, social media, etc) but digital and decentralized.
- Not issued and controlled by external entities. Self-soverign.
- globally unique
- resolvable with high availability
- cryptographically verifiable
- persistent without continued operation of any org.
- Immune to issues of centralized and centrally stored identifiers (fraudulent replication, identity theft, revokation, outages)
- Use Cases: https://www.w3.org/TR/did-use-cases/

## What is Self-Soverign Id?
- self-owned credentials : “Login with Google” must become “Login with my own, revokable, identity” 
- data and keys stored in wallet and share only what is needed with service providers
- Possibly use zk-proofs to do KYC without sharing any information
- Reliance on blockchain and cryptographic proofs to keep PI data only within wallet
